## 🔬 Project Overview
This project automates the detection and sizing of nanoparticles in Electron Microscopy (SEM/TEM) images. By leveraging computer vision techniques and deep learning, this tool aims to replace manual particle counting—a bottleneck in materials science research—with a robust, automated pipeline.

## 💡 Motivation
During my time as a **Project Fellow at STIC** and **Scientific Assistant at VIT**, I operated high-resolution microscopes (JEOL JEM 2100HR, FEI Quanta FEG 250) and manually analyzed over **300 samples per month**. 

The manual characterization of nanomaterials (sizing, distribution analysis) is:
* **Time-intensive:** Hours spent manually measuring particles.
* **Subjective:** Prone to human error and fatigue.

This project bridges my background in **Nanotechnology and Physics** with **Machine Learning** to solve this specific industry challenge.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `data/`: Raw SEM/TEM images (not included in repo for privacy/size reasons).
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model prototyping.
* `src/`: Python scripts for image preprocessing and detection logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Image Processing:** OpenCV, Scikit-image
* **Data Analysis:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* **Modeling:** PyTorch / Scikit-learn (To be implemented)
